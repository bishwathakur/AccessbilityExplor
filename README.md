# Short Video Counter Accessibility App

## Overview

This application is designed to promote digital well-being by helping users become more conscious of their short-form video consumption habits. It counts and displays the number of short videos (such as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok videos, etc.) watched by the user, aiming to reduce mindless scrolling and excessive screen time.

## Problem Statement

The current generation faces challenges with:
- Excessive time spent on smartphones
- Addictive nature of short-form video content
- Mindless scrolling leading to decreased productivity
- Potential negative impacts on mental health and attention spans

## Solution

Our Video Counter Accessibility App addresses these issues by:
1. Tracking the number of short videos watched
2. Displaying a prominent counter on the screen

## How It Works
